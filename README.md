# reactorplate
 An very opinionated boilerplate for React w/TypeScript.  It includes the tooling that I find useful in almost every React project.  If you're concerned that parts you don't use will blow out your deploy size, tree-shaking will make sure that only the parts that are critical for your app functioning will be included.
