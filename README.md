# reactorplate

An very opinionated boilerplate for React w/TypeScript. It includes the tooling that I find useful in almost every React project. If you're concerned that parts you don't use will blow out your deploy size, tree-shaking will make sure that only the parts that are critical for your app functioning will be included.
